    Behaviour by `lang`:
      - lang == "en"  → ALWAYS appends an English-strict directive instructing
        the model to respond entirely in English and translate any quoted
        non-English content. When `source_languages` includes any non-English
        code, OR when callers explicitly mark strict mode via the intent,
        emits the STRONG variant naming the source script (e.g. "Devanagari")
        as forbidden in the response.
        Rationale: previously this branch was a no-op, leaving Gemini free to
        code-switch into the source-document's language. That produced the
        Marathi-PDF + English-query → mixed-language bug. The directive
        closes that hole at the localization layer so every downstream agent
        inherits the fix.
      - lang != "en" and in SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES → emits the existing
        strict / non-strict directive set (script + numerals + ceremonial-
        block translations). Unchanged.
      - lang unsupported → no language line is appended (intent block only).

            PDF is in play). Used ONLY to escalate the English-strict
